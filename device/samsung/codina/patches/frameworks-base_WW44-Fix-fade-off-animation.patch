Subject: [PATCH] Fix unusual fade off animation when removing language

When change all menu item display property from SHOW_AS_ACTION_NEVER
to SHOW_AS_ACTION_ALWAYS, it will call ListPopupWindow.show()
finally. Since the menu item is changed to show as action, the popup
window height is changed to 0 and then the popup window will be
updated to the wrong position with animation. So it would be better
to skip operation at that time.
