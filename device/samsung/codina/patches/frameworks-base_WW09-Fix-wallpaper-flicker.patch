Subject: [PATCH] Fix for wallpaper flicker on bootup on some targets

We see wallpaper flicker in Android N on some devices. Issue
happens due to wallpaper target keyguard Scrim being destroyed
and new wallpaper target statusbar coming up. This creates a
surface with width & height larger than the device supported
width and height. This causes a momentary jank in UI during
bootup.
