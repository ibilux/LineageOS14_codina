Subject: [PATCH] Abort connecting to native daemon during shutdown

Symptom:
System_server crashed due to unsolved "netd" service.

Root cause:
Init intentionally killed services when shutdown was triggered.
NativeDaemonConnector unnecessarily tried to reconnect the killed
daemon and NetworkManagemantService got a callback of connection.
Finally, NetworkManagemantService failed to get netd service and it
crashed with NPE.

Solution:
Do not retry connecting to the target native daemon when the device
is in the middle of shutdown.
