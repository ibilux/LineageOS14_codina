Subject: [PATCH] Catch IllegalStateException to avoid system crash

The locale for decryption UI is stored via daemon.
Daemon is "vold" on Android L.
Daemon is "cryptd" on Android M.
When the response of daemon is delayed,
IllegalStateException is thrown from NativeDaemonConnector
due to time out.
That causes system crash on booting etc.

To solve this issue, catch code is added.
If exception is thrown, phone is running without storing
locale for decryption UI.
When phone is encrypted, decryption UI is translated
by default locale(English), not setup locale by user.
It is side effect.
But system crash is bigger impact than it.
