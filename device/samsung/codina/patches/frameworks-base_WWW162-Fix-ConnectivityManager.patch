Subject: [PATCH] Fix: ConnectivityManager is initialized with a wrong context

Symptom:
BT tethering was failed due to security exception. The error message
said it's requested by "android" package without system uid.

Root cause:
ActivityThread#setHttpProxy uses a system context to get
a ConnectivityManager instance. Unexpectedly, ConnectivityManager with
the system context is cached to the system service registry when it's
not cached yet. The wrong context is always reused when getting
ConnectivityManager.

Solution:
Use an Application context to get ConnectivityManager if it can be used.
